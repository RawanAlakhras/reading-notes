# Object-Oriented Programming

## What Is an Object?

* An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. 
* Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. 
* They all have state and behavior
*  An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages).
* Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
* Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:
  * Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.
  * Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
  * Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
  * Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.


## What Is a Class?

* A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

* Decimals: Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which,Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller
* Bases: The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10.
* Binary Numbers: are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits
* Hexadecimal Numbers: there are 16 of them.They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
