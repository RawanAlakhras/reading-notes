# Color in CSS
The color property allows you 
to specify the color of text inside 
an element. You can specify any 
color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values
2. hex codes
3. color names
 ``` css
h1 {
color: DarkCyan;}
/* hex code */
h2 {
color: #ee3e80;}
/* rgb value */
p {
color: rgb(100,100,90);}
```
* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast 
between any text and the background color (otherwise 
people will not be able to read your content).
* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA
