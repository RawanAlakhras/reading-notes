# Introduction
## How People Access the Web?
* Browsers: You can access a website using a special softwar called web browsers popular examples are :<br>
Firefox , Chrome , Opera and safari
* Web servers : special requests are sent to a special computer called web server in order for that server to respond and give useful information.
* Devices : Accesing web pages can be done through out a wide varity of devices like desktops , laptops and mobile phones etc. 
* Screen readers : special software that can read the content to the user and specially used by people who have visual impairments.
## How Websites Are Created ?
* What you see
When you are looking at a 
website, it is most likely that 
your browser will be receiving 
HTML and CSS from the web 
server that hosts the site.
* Small websites are often written 
just using HTML and CSS.
* Larger websites  often 
make use of more complex 
technologies on the web server
* The most recent versions of HTML is 5 and for CSS is 3 . Websites are mainly built by HTML ,CSS But in the new era new technologies formed up.
## How the Web Works
1. First you connect to a ISP which Internet Service Provider and you type the domain name so your browser can establish a connection.

2. Then you connect to a DNS which is Domain Name System and it's roll to give your browser information like ip and connection type to that very specific website and also sends a special code to authorize the access .
3. The unique number returns to your Computer and at this moment you have been authorized to access that website .
# Structure of a web page :
* Web pages are a digitalized version of the usual documents that we are facing every day How is that ?
They act like a news paper in structure with a heading and a subheading and maybe an image below of it and that to achieve a hierarchy information displaying .
* HTML pages are text documents.
* **HTML elements**: Elements are usually 
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag 
has an extra forward slash in it.)it is  tells the browser 
something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
* HTML tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go
* The main anatomy of a web page is the mainly 3 tags Which are the html , head and body tags and mainly the only tag that gets rendered to the page is the body tag .
# Extra Markup
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you 
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the ```<!-- and --> ```markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements and in more details :
   * Class : Can be used in more than one element "Not Unique" and the most common identifier.
   * ID : Can't be used for more than one element "Unique".
* Block Elements :which are elements that will always 
appear to start on a new line in the browser window. such as :```<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.```
* Inline Elements:which are elements that will always 
appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring 
elements.such as :```<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.```
* The ```<div> and <span>``` elements allow you to group 
block-level and inline elements together.
* ```<iframes>``` cut windows into your web pages through 
which other pages can be displayed.
* The ```<meta>``` tag allows you to supply all kinds of 
information about your web page such as:description, keywords ,robots, author ,pragma and expires.
* Escape characters are used to include special 
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©
# HTML5 Layout
* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of  different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple ``` <div> ``` elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
## Headers & Footers:
The ``` <header>``` and ```<footer>```elements can be used for:
* The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
* A header or footer for an individual ```<article> ```or ```<section>``` within the page.
## Navigation ```<nav>```:
 is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
## Articles```<article>```
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
## Asides ```<aside>```
* when the ```<aside>``` element is used inside an ```<article>```element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. <br>
* When the ```<aside>``` element is used outside of an ```<article>```element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
## Sections ```<section>```
The ```<section>``` element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
## To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer
``` html 
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/
 trunk/html5.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```
# Process & Design
>before building our website we should understand this things :
*  It is very important to understand who your target audience is.
*  Why People Visit YOUR Website?
*  What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
*  What Information Your Visitors Need?
*  How Often People Will Visit Your Site?
>after that we can do something called site maps which it create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.
* WireFrames:e is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
# JavaScript 
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
>To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
1. DEFINE THE GOAL
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3. CODE EACH STEP 
>COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA.
* OBJECTS :each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object.
* Each object can have its own:Properties ,Events and Methods.
* PROPERTIES:Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object. 
* EVENTS:are interaction between object and user.
* METHODS :Methods represent things people need to do with objects. 
>Using the document object, you can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.
