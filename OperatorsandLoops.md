# Operators and Loops
## Comparison Operators
* == :is Equal to <br>
  this operator comares tow values to see if they are the same.
 * === :strict equal to<br>
  compares two values to chech that both the data type and value are the same.
* != :is not equal to <br>
  this operator compares tow values to see if they are not the same .
* !== :strict not equal to <br>
  compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same .
* < :less than <br>
  checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right .
* <= : less than or equal to <br>
  checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right .
* ```>``` :greter than <br>
  checks if the nuber on the left is greater than the number on the right.
* ```>=```  : greater than or equal to <br>
checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right .
## Logical Operators
* && :Logical and <br>
  test more than one condition ,if both expression to true then the expression returns true.
* || :Logical or <br>
  test  at least one condition,if either expression evaluates to true then the expression returns true.
* ! :Logical not <br>
* take a single boolean value and inverts it . 
# Loop 
> There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
### FOR 
if you need to run code a specific number of times .
``` javascript
for (var i = 0 ; i<10 ;i++)
{

}
```
### WHILE 
If you don't know how many times the code should run 
```javascript 
while(condition ){
    do something
}
```
### do-while
it will always run the statement at least once,even if the condition evaluates to false .
```javascript 
do {
   
}while(condition);
```
