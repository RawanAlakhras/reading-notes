# Growth Mindset:
**Growth Mindset** is developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent.<br>
The aptly named growth mindset helps us grow in whatever we pursue – especially in our work.<br>
 When we’re growing, we’re more productive. And when I’m productive, I feel better. <br><br>
 ## how to keep myself in a growth mindset:
 *  try to recognize the problem, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward.
 *  stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of me, walk away, and return when I feeling more inspired. 
 *  I’ve learned to ask myself two questions:
    1.  What was the best part of the day?
    2.  What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?<br><br>
   
 A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals❤.
