# REST

* Who is Roy Fielding?<br>
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internetâ€¦ and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
* Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET
* f one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST
* If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT
* to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH
