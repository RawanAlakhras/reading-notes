# In memory storage

## What is a ‘call’?

* The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call).
* the call stack is synchronous.
* A call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
* the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out .
* The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame.
* A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

## What is a ‘refrence error’?

Types of error messages :

* Reference errors :
  * This happens when trying to reach variables that are not yet declared .
  * or hoisting let and const that takes time to hoist .
  * to fix this error declare before initialization .

* Syntax errors :
  * this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax .
  * Ex : parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
  * This can be solved by just fixing the syntax .

* Range errors :
  * manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length IS THE CAUSE .
  * The best approach and best practice is ti immute your variables and don't mess with the lengths .
* Type errors
  * his types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible .
  * To fix this make atesting variable or test if the variable or object exists .
* Debugging :
  * To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() .
  * by using chrome developer tools .
  * The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.
* Handling errors
  * We use try and catch to handle errors .
  * That will make errors not to break the whole code .
  * The errors will show in a different way .
* Tools for preventing runtime Errors :
  * quokka to evaluate your code as you type
  * eslint to make sure your style guide is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way and
For those of you looking to make JS a more strong typed experience you can check out stuff like TypeScript (like I said in a previous article, when learning I rather avoid libraries that abstract the core language so I wouldn’t recommend this last one when starting).
