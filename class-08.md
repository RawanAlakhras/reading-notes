# Layout

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-levelbox or an inline box. 
   * Block-level elements start on a new line.
   * Inline elements flow in between surrounding text .
* Containing Elements: If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
* Controlling the Position of Elements:CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: 
   * Normal flow:Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. 
   * Relative Positioning:This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top,right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.
   * Absolute positioning:This positions the element in relation to its containing element. 
* Floating Elements: Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.
* When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. 
* The z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.
